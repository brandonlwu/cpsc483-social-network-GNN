We built a message-passing GNN (GraphSAGE) to predict friendships on social network graphs (Facebook and Google Plus from the SNAP Stanford database)

### Set up

1. Import modules and their respective versions from `requirements.txt`
2. Run `FINAL_FACEBOOK_PROJECT.ipynb` in Colab to run model on Facebook dataset
3. Run `FINAL_GPLUS_PROJECT.ipynb` in Colab to run model on Google Plus dataset
